As a consequence people who dislike %{1:rick} %{1:rest} truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in %{1:rick}'s existencial catchphrase \"Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.\nI'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the %{1} from a %{2} %{3} it is to a %{2} %{3} it isn't, and arriving at a %{2} %{3} it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the %{2} %{3} it is, is now the %{2} that it wasn't, and it follows that the %{2} that it was, is now the %{2} that it isn't.\n\nIn the event that the %{2} that it is in is not the %{2} that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between %{3} the %{1} is, and %{3} it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the %{1} must also know %{3} it was.\n\nThe %{1} guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the %{1} has obtained, it is not sure just %{3} it is. However, it is sure %{3} it isn't, within reason, and it knows %{3} it was. It now subtracts %{3} it should be from %{3} it wasn't, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of %{3} it shouldn't be, and %{3} it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error."
